# ChatBot:
Implemented IRC chatbot which called a weather RESTful API and movie RESTful API, in turn displaying results in JSON format to client via free-node server.

# Instructions for logging into the server:
Run the application in the main file, then open up firefox (note it must be firefox or else it wont work) then visit [free-node] (https://webchat.freenode.net). Use the nickname 'user' and the channel 'jake1900'. Once you log into the server you must change the nickname at the bottom of the page then leave and rejoin the channel on the left-handside using 'jake1900'. Wait a few seconds for the bot to join.

# Instructions for using the bot:
Ask what the weather is then follow the instructions given by the bot (note: first statement given to the bot must contain 'weather'). Ask for information about a movie then follow the instructions given by the bot (note: first statement given to the bot must contain 'movie').
